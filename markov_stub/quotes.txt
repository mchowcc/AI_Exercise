To be, or not to be, that is the question.
I think, therefore I am.
The unexamined life is not worth living.
Knowledge is power.
All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.
I came, I saw, I conquered.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
To err is human, to forgive, divine.
Et tu, Brute.
All that glitters is not gold.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
Hell is other people.
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Liberty, equality, fraternity.
Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Time is money.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Actions speak louder than words.
Fortune favors the bold.
The truth will set you free.
Practice makes perfect.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
All good things must come to an end.
Practice what you preach.
Better late than never.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The early bird catches the worm.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
No pain, no gain.
Rome was not built in a day.
United we stand, divided we fall.
The customer is always right.
You reap what you sow.
Honesty is the best policy.
Seeing is believing.
Silence is golden.
Actions have consequences.
It is what it is.
History repeats itself.
Time heals all wounds.
Live and let live.
Experience is the best teacher.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Hope springs eternal.
Power to the people.
The devil is in the details.
Beggars can’t be choosers.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Ignorance is bliss.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
Money talks.
Opportunity knocks but once.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Pride goes before a fall.
Respect is earned, not given.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
There is no place like home.
Time waits for no one.
To each their own.
Two heads are better than one.
Variety is the spice of life.
What goes around comes around.
When it rains, it pours.
Winners never quit and quitters never win.
Wisdom begins in wonder.
You can’t judge a book by its cover.
You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
You can’t please everyone.
You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.
Don’t burn your bridges.
Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill.
Easy come, easy go.
Every rose has its thorn.
Good things come to those who wait.
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
It’s always darkest before the dawn.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Knowledge speaks, wisdom listens.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Life is short, art is long.
Live by the sword, die by the sword.
Love conquers all.
Misery loves company.
No man is an island.
Old habits die hard.
One step at a time.
Only the strong survive.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Patience is a virtue.
Seize the day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Speak of the devil.
The calm before the storm.
The end justifies the means.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.
This too shall pass.
To live is to learn.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
We are what we repeatedly do.
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.
What is done is done.
Where there is smoke, there is fire.
Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic.
You are the master of your fate.
You can run, but you can’t hide.
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
